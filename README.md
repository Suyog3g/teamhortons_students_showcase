# Team Hortons!

Welcome to our website, which focuses on responsive, mobile-first platform design and development. Our goal is to develop a remarkable online venue where students may display their outstanding abilities and accomplishments in advance of the upcoming Industry Night event.

Our team is committed to making these portfolios come to life by utilising the most up-to-date web design and development methods to provide a platform that is aesthetically attractive and engaging. We believe in the value of highlighting these kids' abilities and accomplishments as we get ready for Industry Night because it will make them stand out in front of possible employers and professionals in the field.
